Author's additional comments:
It isn't all that I wanted because of limitations on faces
and the fact that an artist I am not.
This model was a particular challenge because of all the details.
Just wish there was a way to make semi-transparent faces.
The legs would have been more true to life, but I was determined
to keep the face count down - also would have added real coils
to the sides of the head instead of my crappy drawing.
Note: Using a mouse for artwork sucks.

Mail me with any words of wisdom if you like -
or kick my butt on WON like everyone else...
Laters.
