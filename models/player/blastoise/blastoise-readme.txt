Modeled by: Thomas Beswick
Face Count: 786
Unzip Folder: Blastoise <i.e. players/Blastoise>

Just create a Blastoise folder in the models/player and then unzip into the players/Blastoise directory and have fun.

I was just looking at the list of Pokemon, when I thought how cool it would be if they all were kolling each other! Its not so easy to make ALL the Pokemon but those that are a basic biped can be done in a few days. I starsed With Blastoise because hes round and easy. When he was done he had 1566 faces and half-life only suports 700-800 (uh-oh). but I managed to fix that!
