Place the two files in a new folder called 
\sierra\half-life\valve\models\player\Dukowski
The folder needs to be named the same as the
model, or it won't work correctly.

This is our first model for Half-Life. Dukowski, a cunning soldier, who is well
skilled with combat weapons and explosives. He'll snipe you from the shadows or
get up in your face and crack your skull with a crowbar. Always look over your
shoulder, cause he'll be there.

Sorry, no team colors in this one. I may do it in the future, but I couldn't mess with 
Pred's pretty skin. We'll be doing more skins in the future, to fill out the team.

If anyone would like to use this for mods, or put up a team server, contact us.

Thanks to Valve, for not only a great game, but a great game to edit. We're looking 
forward to Team Fortress 2!

The .mdl file is the model you will see during play.  The .bmp file is
necessary for the model to be selectable via the launcher interface.  For
a player model to be visible to all clients playing, it must be installed on
the server for it to propogate to all playing clients.

When a model is downloaded from the game server, it does not download the
.bmp file necessary for selecting the model in the interface: models must be
deliberately installed by the player.
