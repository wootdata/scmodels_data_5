A model of the Terminator by Flayer!

	Took me about 3 days to skin and is intended for use by the Beach Buggy Bannanas! (http://www.homestead.com/chrisallport/bbb.html)  If you inteand to use it for another clan THEN DON'T! (or at least ask me!)  You are welcome to use this skin for a base but PLEASE no crappy sticking letters on it for a clan and not tellin me!

If you downloaded the skin then please send me a mail at BBB_Flayer@Hotmail.com with the title "Terminator" so I can see how many people got it!

Any comments/sugestions should also be sent to the above address, but don't entitle 'em terminaor eh?



ENJOY!
