Here's an idea of who Jake is:
"Big" Jake Sullivan was a US Marine before the bombs fell.  After the war, the government was gone, and the marines took control of everything they could occupy, becoming an oppressive force, taking what they wanted and generally having no sense of honor or concience.  Think the Holnists from The Postman. Jake deserted early on in this transition, and just disappeared.  He wandered for a while before finding steady work as a town guard in a medium sized village plagued with raiders.  It soon became apparent that Jake posessed exceptional skill with most any kind of small arms, and he quickly rose through the ranks, becoming captain of the guard in a matter of weeks.  But the attacks grew more severe, and USMC fatigues began to be found among the dead raiders.  Jake knew they had come for him, and in order to save the town, he left what passed for his life behind to endlessly wander the wastes, taking odd jobs where he could to stave off starvation and trying to stay one step ahead of his ex CO.

I'm planning to make the CO soon.
