Description             : Half-Life (HLDM) Player Model of a Penguin_baby

Additional Credits to   : [USA]Rev for paying for my copy of MilkShape that
			  let me create this model.

                          Also, to DocRock and and BabyKitKat for inspiring me
                          to convert this model and create a monster version
                          for a new map.
=============================================================================

This is a converted and re-animated player model of a Penguin_baby created from a mesh
that originally came from the OP4 distribution.  The original Penguin_baby was a small
monster model that had a grenade on its back and acted somewhat like a snark.

This model mesh was converted and rescaled, with skeleton and animations
that were converted and scaled from a variety of different Half-Life models.

This version is a 1/2 sized model, about the same size as the original mesh.

If you don't like 1/2 sized models, just copy the full-sized penguin.mdl model
to the Penguin_baby directory and rename it Penguin_baby.mdl

All model work was done in Milkshape 1.6.5.

All of the graphics work was done using Microsoft Imager2,
Wally, Photostyler, mgi Photosuite, and any other tool that
let me do what I needed.

I created the entire mesh in one session, about 2 hours total time.  The
animations took another 2 hours and there were several hours checking all
the animations (LOL, you should have seen what it looked like at Cucamonga
Chunk O'Phlem with 8 or 10 Penguin_babys fragging 8 or 10 Spongebobs, it was
totally hilarious!).

This model is a a full sized model.

This model has the following statistics:
Verticies: 134
Triangles: 178
   Groups: 1
Materials: 1
   Joints: 24

All in all, an extremely fast and good looking model I think!
